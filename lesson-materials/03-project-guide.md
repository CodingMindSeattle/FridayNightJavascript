## Getting Started with Your Project

### Step 1: Open Your Project Folder
Navigate to the project folder:
- `projects/simple-clicker/` (Level 0 - Super Easy!)
- `projects/interactive-story/` (Level 1 - Easy)
- `projects/simple-game/` (Level 2 - Medium)
- `projects/pet-simulator/` (Level 3 - Advanced)

### Step 2: Open the HTML File
Each project has a pre-built HTML file with all the structure you need. Open it in your browser to see what it looks like!

### Step 3: Look at the Starter JavaScript
Open `script-starter.js` - it has:
- Variables already set up
- Comments explaining what to do
- `// TODO:` markers where you should add code

### Step 4: Connect Your JavaScript
Make sure the HTML file is loading your JavaScript:
```html
<script src="script-starter.js"></script>
```

### Step 5: Start Small!
1. First, just try to console.log something
2. Then try changing one thing on the page
3. Add one event listener
4. Build from there!

## Tips for Success üèÜ

### Use the Console!
- Add `console.log()` statements to see what's happening
- Check for red error messages
- Test variables by typing them in the console

### Work Step by Step
Don't try to build everything at once:
1. Get one button working
2. Test it thoroughly
3. Then add the next feature

### When You're Stuck

**Check these common issues:**
1. **Is your JavaScript file connected?**
   - Check the console for errors
   - Add a `console.log("Connected!")` at the top

2. **Are your IDs matching?**
   - The ID in HTML must match exactly in JavaScript
   - Remember: IDs are case-sensitive!

3. **Is the element found?**
   ```javascript
   let element = document.getElementById("myId");
   console.log(element);  // Should not be null
   ```

### Customization Ideas üí°

Once your basic project works, make it yours!

**Visual Customization:**
- Change colors to your favorites
- Add emoji to buttons and text
- Modify sizes and fonts

**Feature Additions:**
- Add sound effects (ask for help!)
- Create difficulty levels
- Add more choices/options

**Personal Touches:**
- Use your friends' names
- Add inside jokes
- Create your own story/theme

## Debugging Checklist üîç

When something's not working:

- [ ] Is there a red error in the console?
- [ ] Are all your variable names spelled correctly?
- [ ] Did you remember quotation marks around strings?
- [ ] Are your IDs matching between HTML and JavaScript?
- [ ] Did you save your file?
- [ ] Did you refresh the browser?

## Challenge Yourself! üöÄ

### Easy Challenges
- Add 3 more buttons to your project
- Change colors based on user actions
- Add a reset button

### Medium Challenges
- Add keyboard controls (spacebar, arrow keys)
- Create a score that saves even after refresh
- Add animations with CSS classes

### Hard Challenges
- Add a timer/countdown
- Create multiple levels or screens
- Add a leaderboard

## Remember...

- **There's no wrong way to be creative!**
- **Bugs are normal** - even professional programmers get them
- **Ask questions** when you're stuck
- **Have fun** and make it your own!
